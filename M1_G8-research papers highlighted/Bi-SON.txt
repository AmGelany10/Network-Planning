Energy Efficient Ultra-Dense Small Cells



#Date of Publication
=2016



#Objective of paper
=optimize energy efficiency
of ultra-dense small cells.



#Motivation of the Objective
=Although small cell can enhance
the capacity of cellular mobile networks, ultra-dense small cells
suffer from severe interference and poor energy efficiency.
and
=we develop a big-data self organizing network
(Bi-SON) framework with data-driven dynamic power
control scheme to improve energy efficiency of the outdoor
ultra-dense small cell network system.



#A QoS requirement.
1)Bi-SON can improve throughput and energy efficiency by 50%
and 135% respectively, compared to the scheme without energy
saving approach.
2)Bi-SON with data-driven dynamic power control scheme can
improve 50% higher cell throughput and 135% higher energy
efficiency respectively, compared to the approach without any
power control in the 5G ultra-dense small cell network.

=Our proposed
Bi-SON suggests a data flow framework from data collection,
analysis and optimization to reconfiguration. We adopt the
statistics analysis approach to determine the optimal system
parameters to improve the energy efficiency of a huge number
of outdoor small cells. The Bi-SON mechanism periodically
collects the management data of small cells, e.g. transmission
power, reference signal receiving power and the number of users
per cell. We find that simple sorting and filtering data analysis
from huge number of small cells can already effectively find
the almost optimal solution.


#weakness
1) The static analysis model can not
update the polynomial coefficients with the density variations
of active users, while the D3A model can periodically update
the polynomial coefficients every three hour.
2) We assume
that the macro cell and the small cell use different frequency
for transmission so that there is no cross-tier interference,
and the co-channel interference exists only in the small cell
layer.

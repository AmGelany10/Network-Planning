#Date of Publication
=2017



#Objective of paper
=The energy efficiency in a 5G network of small cells with
multi-last-mile connections is thus the focus of this work



#Motivation of the Objective
=Energy Efficient Ultra-Dense Small Cells can reduce
networks’ carbon footprint and energy bills.



#A QoS requirement.
1)in this work reaches quality of experience (QoE)
targets while reducing the energy consumption by up to 21.9%
and maintaining the total system throughput.
2)In brief, the proposed algorithm has effectively
improved the energy efficiency of the backhaul network by
11.4% at the cost of slight degradation in total throughput of 2.44% and 1.16% users’ QoE.



#Is the Problem linear /non-linear
=non-linear



#Techniques used to solve the problem
=Manhattan grid
=sliding-window concepts


#Their suggested future work
=no future work mentioned


#centralized /decentralized
=The scheme uses a two-steps optimisation approach: the first is
centralised and the second is distributed.

==========================

#what exactly the research does ?
=offering an energy-efficient approach to the new user-centric backhaul
concept in a heterogeneous and hybrid backhaul network. The
approach is automated and it successfully mediates between three
conflicting optimisation objectives: network, users, and energy
key performance indicators.
=The energy efficiency in a 5G network of small cells with
multi-last-mile connections is thus the focus of this work.


#weaknesses
=the total network throughput - a network KPI, witnesses a slight degradation of 2.44%, on average.
=the number of active last-mile backhaul links has dropped from a constant 18×100 in the UCB scenario to 1571 over the recorded period, indicating a reduction of 12.72%.
=some points is mentioned in sensitivity analysis section as effect of paramteres tuning:
-When the minimum load is decreased from 20% to
10% between Scenarios (A and A1) and (A4 and A4.1), the
resulting throughput and QoE degradation is reduced as well as
the energy efficiency gain.
-when the load threshold is increased to 30% in Scenario A2,
the energy efficiency gain is improved but higher degradation
in throughput and QoE is recorded.
-The accepted QoE gap is changed to 5% in Scenario A3,
resulting in further reduction in total throughput and degradation
in users’ QoE, compared to the basic Scenario A
with 1% setting. However, the gain in energy efficiency has
significantly improved (21.9%).
-reducing the accepted QoE gap to 0.5% has the opposite
effect, and the gains of the proposed algorithm become limited,
as shown with Scenario A4.
-The role of the sliding windows sizes is assessed next, by reducing
the activation sliding window separately or both activation and deactivation windows
less stable behaviour of the proposed algorithm
with more frequent toggling between ON/OFF status.
without considerable gain in energy efficiency nor network or
users’ KPIs.

#Objective of paper
=obtaining the simulatenously optimal solution for many objective functions in 5G WN with mMIMO, such as user data rate, energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, and average area rate



#Motivation of the Objective
=On the basis of current advances, the issues of 5G networks that aren't fully stated in LTE-advanced systems should be addressed.
Higher data rate, energy efficiency, area rate, and spectrum efficiency are the four factors.
A solution to one problem may deteriorate a solution to another. In addition, optimizing the all aspects together in one
model without converting them into single problems.



#A QoS requirement.
=If the total number of users is constant, then the energy efficiency will increase with the number of BS antennas, but the
energy efficiency is not increased with the number of BS antennas after reaching certain point because of the restriction
of the total number of users in the network.
=the spectral efficiency attains its maximum value with less number of BS antennas and
users.
=the transmission rate per unit area is linearly increased
with number of transmitting antenna, but the performance of the average area rate will be reduced while increasing
the radius of the area.
=the data rate per user will be increased when the number of antenna array at the BS is increased.
However, the user rate will be reduced when the number of users in a cell is increased.
=The result shows that the average area rate is decreased with the increase in the average user rate.
For the average user rate and energy efficiency objectives are conflicting with one another because if one
needs to increase the user rate means, he should make radical sacrifices in the energy efficiency. One more trade-off is
shown in Figure 4C, wherein the energy efficiency and average area rate are related. In this graph, both the objectives
are linearly increased until the energy efficiency reaches its maximum value, but further improvement in area rate may
loss some energy efficiency.

==========================

#what exactly the research does ?
The main contributions of our proposed work are as follows:
• To develop an optimization framework for optimizing the downlink communication of a mMIMO network to find a
trade-off between four conflicting objectives: average area rates, average user rates, spectral efficiency, and energy
efficiency.
• To introduce a novel self-organizing particle swarm optimizer (SOMPSO) for determining nondominated solutions in
one run without converting the problems into a single optimization problem as the traditional MOO approaches.
• To construct neighborhood relations in decision space, this will maintain the diversity of the solution by integrating
SOM with the MOPSO algorithm. Here, SOM is used to determine the solution distribution of the present population
by picking the neighborhood relations. It improves the distribution characteristics in both decision and objective
space.
• To increase the diversity of the Pareto optimal sets, an elite learning methodology is used.



#weaknesses
=This is the assumption made by us for simplifying the definition.
In order to avoid intracellular interference, zero-forcing precoding is performed. It forms a beam, and the power
allocation is adapted for guaranteeing a similar rate to each user (neglect intracellular interference).
=approximate PFs are acquired once the optimization framework reaches 250 iterations (small number of ieration).
